# 1. Computer player Tic-Tac-Toe game using Mini-Max algorithm
[Working web app](http://gmilana.pythonanywhere.com/)
<br /> This repository is a computer player Tic-Tac-Toe game in the form of a Flask web app with decision making done using the minimax algorithm. The Mini-Max algorithm is commonly used to find the optimal move in games such as as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc, Described by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) as "A decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.". More simply it is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. Even more simply it is an algorithm that uses an evaluation method that a mazimizing player uses to find the best move to raises the score of the game state while its opponent the minimizer chooses its move based on lowering the score of the boards game state.
